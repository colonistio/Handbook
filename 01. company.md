## About Colonist
  
**[Colonist.io](https://colonist.io/)** is an online alternative to one of the world’s most popular board games, Settlers of Catan. 
+ Players: 3K-8K concurrent players
+ Games: 150K+ games played daily
+ If Colonist was a Steam game, it would be in the [top 150 in online count](https://steamcharts.com/top/p.8), surpassing many AAA games such as MapleStory, MORDHAU, Sims 3, Portal 2, Borderlands, Magic The Gathering, Among Us.
  
## Opportunity
+ **Catan** (since 1995):
  +  45M+ copies sold (Assumed 60% is base game)
  +  120M+ players worldwide (Estimated)
  +  Until 2025 we reached 12M players, only 10% of potential players

+ **Monopoly** (since 1935):
  +  275M+ copies sold
  +  1B+ players worldwide (Estimated)
  
Next step: After capturing the Catan audience, we aim to grow into the broader board game market.

### Growth levers (2025 Nov)
Our growth levers will change overtime. The below are only for Colonist. Our next online boardgames will also contribute.

+ ARPU. Current model is under-monetized; moving to a coins-based system offers ~10x improvement potential
+ Retention. Basic engagement features (daily rewards, FTUE) are missing; adding them is expected to increase retention
+ New users. We’ve captured only 5% of the total player base; significant market remains untapped

## Vision & Mission

### Vision

Vision:
To redefine the online board game experience

Details:
Dozens of online Catan alternatives existed before us. None matched our depth, competitive design, and social experience. We reimagined the classic board game into a digital version that captures the hearts of millions. We will do the same for others.

### Mission

Mission:
Provide an accessible, competitive, and social Catan experience

Details:
Monopoly Go, Yahtzee, Chess, Words with Friends reached top 100 in App Stores. Catan is a game in the same tier selling similar copies per year. It should achieve similar results in the digital space. Top 100 is around 5M MAP and $100M ARR

## Strategy

### Our Goals
- Revenue Growth: 1.5x/year
- Team Size Growth: 1.2x-1.5x/year
- Rating: 4.6 stars
- Metrics: Retention > Users > Monetization

### Our Decisions
- Exit: Don't consider anything under $100M
- License: If it allows fast iteration, creative control, and minimal external permissions
- External Investment: If needed for survival or shows a clear path to +50% yearly growth
- Stock Ownership: Limited to active full-time guild members
- Policies: Choose options that reduces management
- New Games: Start New Games as soon as possible without crippling the old games

### Why 4.6 stars? 
- Below 4.5 (90%) = “bad product” => attract competitors 
- Above 4.5 = “good product” => drives retention, monetization, partnerships  
- 4.6 = buffer so one mistake won’t push us below the line
- Bad Products:
    - If there is a leading bad product in the market, competitors start showing up thinking they can do some part better
    - Colonist only exists because Catan Universe was a bad product
- Good Products:
    - Lead to higher word of mouth, retention, monetization, partnership deals
