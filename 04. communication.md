## Communication

### Internal Communication
- We work asynchronously.
- We need to write knowledge down rather than sharing on meetings.

### Expected Response Times:
- Replies from individuals can take 12–24h. From role groups 1–3h. Self-sufficiency is critical.

Be self sufficient before asking:
* Check documentation. We regularly put our experience in writing.
* Search Discord. Someone probably already asked the same thing.
* Search Google.
* Ask AI.
* Anticipate needs and ask before starting your task

## Escalation
If you cannot resolve an issue, ask your manager.  
Don’t stay blocked.

### External Communication
While communicating with players and outside parties we try to be as honest as possible about the game and what we are doing. However, there are a few secrets. 

+ Details of how some systems work might allow people to exploit them. We use the strategy “security by obscurity” and don't give too much information about our internal workings.
+ Company finances, code, plans are not to be shared.
+ Roadmap and plans should be kept hidden unless we have started working on the feature. The reason is even the next task in our roadmap might be pushed back a couple of years before we start working on it. We don’t want to create expectations that don’t materialize.
