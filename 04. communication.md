# Communication

## Internal Communication
- We work asynchronously.
- We need to write knowledge down rather than sharing on meetings.

### Expected Response Times:
- Replies from individuals can take 12–24h. From role groups 1–3h. Self-sufficiency is critical.

Be self sufficient before asking:
* Check documentation. We regularly put our experience in writing.
* Search Discord. Someone probably already asked the same thing.
* Search Google.
* Ask AI.
* Anticipate needs and ask before starting your task

### Escalation
If you cannot resolve an issue, ask your manager.  
Don’t stay blocked.  

## External Communication
While communicating with players and outside parties we try to be as honest as possible about the game and what we are doing. However, there are a few secrets. 

+ Details of how some systems work might allow people to exploit them. We use the strategy “security by obscurity” and don't give too much information about our internal workings.
+ Company finances, code, plans are not to be shared.
+ Roadmap and plans should be kept hidden unless we have started working on the feature. The reason is even the next task in our roadmap might be pushed back a couple of years before we start working on it. We don’t want to create expectations that don’t materialize.

### Representing Colonist
Everyone at the company represents Colonist. Everyone working at Colonist will communicate with our players and try to help or understand them. Your real boss will be the Colonist players and your real job will be to satisfy them. Everything else is an abstraction.

Try to be fair and do the right thing. What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is “what would you do for a friend or a neighbour if they asked for help?” An example might be providing a refund even if it’s a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says ’Sure we can do that for you’ when a customer expected you to say ’sorry, we can’t.’ If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it. If you’re unsure, feel free to ask in our team chat.
