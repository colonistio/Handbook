  ### Growth levers (2025 Nov)
  Our growth levers will change overtime. The below are only for Colonist. Our next online boardgames will also contribute.
  
  + ARPU. Current model is under-monetized; moving to a coins-based system offers ~10x improvement potential
  + Retention. Basic engagement features (daily rewards, FTUE) are missing; adding them is expected to increase retention
  + New users. We’ve captured only 5% of the total player base; significant market remains untapped
