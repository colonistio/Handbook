# Working

  ## Representing Colonist
  Everyone at the company represents Colonist. Everyone working at Colonist will communicate with our players and try to help or understand them. Your real boss will be the Colonist players and your real job will be to satisfy them. Everything else is an abstraction.

  Try to be fair and do the right thing. What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is “what would you do for a friend or a neighbour if they asked for help?” An example might be providing a refund even if it’s a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says ’Sure we can do that for you’ when a customer expected you to say ’sorry, we can’t.’ If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it. If you’re unsure, feel free to ask in our team chat.

  ## Making Priority Decisions

  ### Company priorities (in order)
  1. Improve player retention
  2. Grow playerbase
  3. Increase revenue per player

  All work should maximize these 3 metrics in the long term. Each metric eventually leads to total revenue, which comes from, and enables, game quality. Ensure anything you build improves one of those 3 things. Use them to guide prioritization.

  ### Player Lifecycle 

1. They find us:
+ Word of mouth
+ SEO

2. They give us a chance:
+ UI, UX
+ Lobby looking busy with players
+ Easy navigation

3. They want to play more:
+ Gamification mechanics
+ Bot levels
+ More content

4.1. They invite friends:
+ Features that encourage inviting friends

4.2. They purchase:
+ Expansions/maps/skins

### Task Checklist 
+ [Does it fit our game pillars?](https://github.com/colonistio/katan/blob/2a97d0d2885f325b36b256e79712574c29711195/docs/company/game-pillars.md)
+ [Does it fit our values?](https://github.com/colonistio/katan/blob/2a97d0d2885f325b36b256e79712574c29711195/docs/company/team-values.md)
+ Does it adress our biggest bottleneck?
+ Does it bring growth? (Revenue, Retention, Users)
+ Does it guarantee results?
+ Does it have long term benefits?
+ Does it take us backwards?

### Decision Framework 
+ If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
+ Between two equal options: take the path that is more difficult and more painful in the short-term.
+ Take the option that will leave you calmer in the long term.

## Consistency
When writing a document, contract, code, designing, illustrating, for anything we’re doing, it must be consistent with all the previous work Colonist has previously done. 

If you want to change a style, then you must have a good reason for change, ask feedback to the previous maintainer of the work. If the style change is accepted you must migrate all the previous things into the new style. A change of style is a different task and don’t do it together with your current task. The proposal should be done separately. 

+ If you’re editing a document which is all written in 14 font size, don’t make new edits in 16 font size.
+ If all code functions start with lower case, don’t write new functions that start with capital case.
+ If all web page design have blue background, don’t add a new page with green background.

If unsure: search, look at what has been done before, and copy that style. We don’t keep style documents unless absolutely necessary, our previous work should be our style document. If you’re still not sure, feel free to ask the maintainer or anyone who has added on top of the piece of work. 

⚠️ Reminder: *Personal preferences don’t define company standards.*  
Inconsistency slows us down and frustrates teammates.  

## Simplicity
+ Our code, our designs, our work, our documents should be as simple as possible. Both from the user side and from the technical side.
+ Focus on sustainable, fast, quality shipment to players.
+ Simplify your work. Then simplify it again.
