## Roles
This is a list of what roles should focus on in order to add value to Colonist and grow the game. All roles in essence have one job. To grow the main metrics of the game. However the path we take there will be different depending on the role. 

However one thing every role needs to do is be on the offensive. Find problems, come up with solutions. Don’t wait for problems to fall on your lap. Don’t wait for someone to tell you to do something. The problems are there, if the path is not clear, ask. But be on the offensive, when someone tells you something, your response should be: “Oh I thought about it, and noted it here, which I will tackle at this point”.

Another thing everyone should think about is measurement. Can I measure or benchmark something which would lead to a better decision?

Another thing everyone should think about is moving fast and throughput. If we fix 2 bugs instead of 1 bug every single day, over a year that is 365 bugs solved. Think about how you can produce twice the output you’re currently producing? Find the solution, implement it and tell us!

### Backend Developer
Backend developer needs to think defensively. For every line of code written, they need to have this mental checklist running in their head:

- [ ]  Is this feature hackable?
- [ ]  Is this algorithm using too many resources?
- [ ]  Is this code clean? Readable? Scalable?
- [ ]  Will an exception or an error crash the whole server?
- [ ]  Is this something that is testable? Does it require tests?
- [ ]  Is this the best architectural pattern I can use?
- [ ]  Does this code have a chance to backfire and mess up some other systems?
- [ ]  After my changes, doe all the functions work as fast as they did before?
- [ ]  Is this feature bulletproof?

If the feature you’re working on passes all these checklists, then it is probably good to go.

### Dev Ops
Dev ops needs to think supportively. For every line of code written, they need to have this mental checklist running in their head:

- [ ]  Does it have a chance to mess up the development environment?
- [ ]  Does it have a chance to slow the output of our team?
- [ ]  Can this create a critical issue where I might need to respond fast?
- [ ]  Is there something I can build to increase the output of the team?
