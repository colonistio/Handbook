## Details
- Why 4.6 stars? 
  - 4.5 or 90% is a value that is the cut off point from a bad product to a good product from consumer and platform eyes
  - Bad Products:
    - If there is a leading bad product in the market, competitors start showing up thinking they can do some part better
    - Colonist only exists because Catan Universe was a bad product
  - Good Products:
    - Lead to higher word of mouth, retention, monetization, partnership deals
  - 1st priority is to not become a bad product, which will ensure that Colonist lives for a long time
  - 2nd priority is to become a good product, which will ensure that Colonist grows
  - 4.6 makes sure that one mistake or bad update doesn't get us below the cut off point
