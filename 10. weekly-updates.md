- Refactored this LINKED file

## 2. What insights did you acquire this week?

- Examples:
  - This question was often misunderstood by newcomers. I updated the explanation to make it clearer for future hires.
  - Sound effects were being unnecessarily triggered by the backend. I updated the structure so that the frontend now controls when to play sound effects.

## 3. What will you work on next week?
> *The more detailed plan you have the more likely you'll achieve it*
- Implement X
 - Talk to 5 users on feature Y to gain insights
 - Message A & B early on so they allocate time for reviewing X

```

## Details:
