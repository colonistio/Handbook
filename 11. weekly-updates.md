# Weekly Update: 12 October 2023

## 1. What did you work on this week?
- Reviewed these LINKED 3 PRs about server scaling issues
- Refactored this LINKED file

### 2. What insights did you acquire this week?
> Please focus on concrete steps or changes that could directly improve the platform or company.
> Avoid personal or general learnings unless they have a clear and practical impact on Colonist.
> Format: â€œI realized/learned A, then did B to improve Colonist.
- Examples:
  - This question was often misunderstood by newcomers. I updated the explanation to make it clearer for future hires.
  - Sound effects were being unnecessarily triggered by the backend. I updated the structure so that the frontend now controls when to play sound effects.

## 3. What will you work on next week?
> *The more detailed plan you have the more likely you'll achieve it*
- Implement X
 - Talk to 5 users on feature Y to gain insights
 - Message A & B early on so they allocate time for reviewing X
- Clarify our meeting goals [DETAILS](link)
```

## Details:
* The update should take 15 minutes max
* Add links and screenshots for reference
* We expect an update even if you were on vacation
* A way to generate lots of insights is to fill out this everyday and send it at the end of the week
* Continue doing weekly updates even after 30days
