# Company Meeting Framework

## Meeting Expectations
- Punctuality is crucial, we can't afford to wait for people
- When presenting ***share entire screen***
- All internal meetings should have an agenda
- When setting up a meeting with people from different time zones use [Worldtimebuddy](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=1880252,1277333,323786,2950159,2643743,3435910,4930956,5391959&h=1880252&hf=0). This already includes the time zones of most of our team.

## Violations
- Misdemeanor: Updating your attendance status in Google Calendar on the same day as the meeting
- Violation: Joining the meeting after the scheduled start time
- Severe Violation: Missing a meeting while your Google Calendar status is set to “Will attend”
Violations will impact bi-annual evaluation.
