  ## Colonist timeline
    
  ### 2017 - Prototype
  Weekly family Catan games ignited the idea to go online and look for existing solutions
  All these solutions had their positives, with huge downsides. The founders thought they could make a better version in 2 weeks, and the first prototype of Colonist was born. 
  Launched [katan.io](http://katan.io) and shared on reddit at 11 December 2017, some Catan fans became interested and started to play.
  
  ### 2018 - Alpha
  PlayCatan was shut down which led to a decent amount of players adopting Katan.io instead of Catan Universe. This traffic growth was promising enough for us to take the risk and focus on this full time.
  
  We quickly added bots, sounds, [redesigned UI](https://imgur.com/a/mefWozQ), [redesigned lobby](https://imgur.com/a/kHkUSoI), added custom game feature with settings like friendly robber/VP/speed, fixed major bugs.
  
  ### 2019 - Beta
  We laid the foundations for the game in 2018, and in 2019 we made it a proper product.

  We added [reconnection](https://prnt.sc/n719b8), private rooms, karma system, [google login](https://prnt.sc/n97a2j), [end game screen](https://prnt.sc/mdkjpn), first fun map, first presale Founder's Packs, [first ads in game](https://prnt.sc/o5wka6).

  We [redesigned the](https://prnt.sc/mltaxm) [trading system](https://prnt.sc/oknfep), [lobby](https://prnt.sc/pirad2), [rooms](https://prnt.sc/pirahf), [game](https://prnt.sc/q5584f), our logo, [lobby again](https://prnt.sc/pmovav), [room again](https://prnt.sc/pnvoxw), [game assets](https://prnt.sc/q7o1hm), patch notes.

  We optimized game for mobile and started running our first tournaments.

  Our other brother [Kan](https://thellimist.com/) joined for 4 months to setup our dev ops infrastructure that weâ€™re still building on top of today. In the middle of the year we were making enough money to cover Colonist costs and buy us food. In August we rebranded the game from [katan.io](http://katan.io/) to [colonist.io](http://colonist.io/)! This meant we were moving from alpha to beta.
  
  ### 2020 - Release & Pandemic Surge

  In 2019 we turned colonist into a proper product. In 2020 covid hit and people noticed this. 

  We added first expansions 5-6 players, 7-8 players, Seafarers, Seafarers 5-6. We added a store and started selling expansions, maps and icons.
